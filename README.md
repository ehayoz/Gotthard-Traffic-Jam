# MATLAB Fall 2014 – Research Plan (Template)

> * Group Name: Traffic Jammers
> * Group participants names: Eric Hayoz, Janick Zwyssig
> * Project Title: Optimizing Traffic Flow At „Gotthard-Strassentunnel“

## General Introduction

Traffic is something every one of us faces in daily life. We want to model the traffic situation in front of the Gotthard-Strassentunnel at Göschnenen/UR. A further goal would be to optimize the current situation.

## The Model

Simulate 2-to-1-lane reduction (situation at "Gotthard-Strassentunnel Nord") and implement:
Nagel-Schreckenberg-Model / Intelligent Driver Model (?)


## Fundamental Questions

How can different methods like drop counting or speed limits optimize traffic flow?


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
